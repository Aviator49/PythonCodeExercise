# PythonCodeExercise

These are the solutions to the coding exercises for the Learn to Code with Python online course by Boris Paskhaver on Udemy.

I am also taking the course to get myself up to speed with the Syntax of the language and would be updating this as I move along the course.
I find the course quite interesting and the teaching method very interactive.

The solutions given here are what I have submitted as my solution to the coding exercises and I hope those taking the course as well can use them as a guide to complete the challenge.

When I started this Git, the course didn't offer any solutions, so you either solved it or you couldn't complete the course. However, around June 2020 Boris (the tutor) uploaded a series of new lectures which explain the solutions to the coding exercises. Although, it looks like a good thing, I find that it makes the course less challenging and the discussions usually had by students of the course were rapidly waning because they could simply watch the video to get the answer. 

I hope to finish the course in the coming weeks and I would keep uploading my solutions here. I would try not to watch the videos, as that would allow me improve my problem solving skills. :)
